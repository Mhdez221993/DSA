## Exceptions, Assertions, and Logging

1. When you throw an exception, control is transferred to the nearest handler of the exception.

2. In Java, checked exceptions are tracked by the compiler.

3. Use the try/catch construct to handle exceptions.

4. The try-with-resources statement automatically closes resources after normal execution or when an exception occurred.

5. Use the try/finally construct to deal with other actions that must occur whether or not execution proceeded normally.

6. You can catch and rethrow an exception, or chain it to another exception.

7. A stack trace describes all method calls that are pending at a point of execution.

8. An assertion checks a condition, provided that assertion checking is enabled for the class, and throws an error if the condition is not fulfilled.

9. Loggers are arranged in a hierarchy, and they can receive logging messages with levels ranging from SEVERE to FINEST.

10. Log handlers can send logging messages to alternate destinations, and formatters control the message format.

11. You can control logging properties with a log configuration file.
