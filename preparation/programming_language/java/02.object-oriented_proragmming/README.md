## Object-Oriented Programming

1. Mutator methods change the state of an object; acdessor mehtod don't.

2. In Java, variables don't hold objects; they hold references to objects.

3. Instance variables and method implementations are decalre inside the calss declaration.

4. An instance method is invked on an object, which is accessible through the `this` refence.

5. A constructor has the same name as the class. A class can have multiple (overloaded) constructors.

6. Static variables don't belong to any objects. Static mehtod are not invoked on objects.

7. A `recond` is a class with puclic accessors for all instace variables.

8. Classes are organized into packeges. Use import decalrtions so tha you don\t have to use the packege name in you programs.

9. Classes can be nested in other classes.

10. An inner class is a nonstatic nested class. Its instances have a refernce to the object o the enclosing class that constructed it.
