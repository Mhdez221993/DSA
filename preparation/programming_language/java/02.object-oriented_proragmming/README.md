## Object-Oriented Programming

1. `Mutator` methods change the state of an object; `accessor` methods don't.

2. In Java, variables don't hold objects; they hold `references` to objects.

3. Instance variables and method implementations are declared inside the class declaration.

4. An instance method is invoked on an object, which is accessible through the `this` reference.

5. A `constructor` has the same name as the class. A class can have multiple `(overloaded)` constructors.

6. Static variables don't belong to any objects. Static methods are not invoked on objects.

7. A `recond` is a class with public accessors for all instace variables.

8. Classes are organized into packages. Use import declarations so that you don't have to use the packege name in your programs.

9. Classes can be nested in other classes.

10. An inner class is a `nonstatic` nested class. Its instances have a reference to the object of the enclosing class that constructed it.

11. The `javadoc` utility processes source files, producing `HTML files` with declarations and programmer-supplied comments.
