## Compiling and Scripting

1. With the `compiler` API, you can access the Java compiler in your programs.

2. You can generate Java code “on the fly” by `reading` source from memory and `writing` classes to memory.

3. The `scripting` API lets Java program interoperate with a number of scripting languages.

4. In your Java code, you can access variables that are `read` and `written` by the `scripting code`.

5. With some scripting engines, you can call script functions from Java.
