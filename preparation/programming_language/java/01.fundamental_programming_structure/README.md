## Fundamental Programming Structures

1. In java, all methods are declared in a class. You invoke a `nonstatic` method on an object of the class to which the method belongs.

2. Static methods are not invoked on objects. Program execution starts with the `static main` method.

3. Java has eight primitive types: `four signed integral` types, `two floating point` types, `chart`, and `boolean`.

4. The Java operators and control structures are very similar to those of `C` or `JavaScript`.

5. There are four forms of `switch` expressions and statements with and without fall through.

6. The `Math` class provides common mathematical functions.

7. `String` objects are sequences of characters or, more precisely, `Unicode` code points in `UTF-16` encoding.

8. Use the `text box` syntax to declare multiline string literals.

9. With the `System.out` object, you can display output in a terminal window. A `Scanner` tied to `System.in` lets you read terminal input.

10. `Arrays` and `collections` can be used to collect elements of the same type.
