### Complexity Analysis

The process of determinimg how efficient an algorithm is. Complxity analysis usually involves finding both the time complexity and space coplexity of an algorithm.
Complexity analysis is effectively used to determine how "good an algorithm is and whether it's 'better than another one.

### Time Complexity

A measure of how fast an algorithm runs, time complexity is a central concept in the field of algorithms and in coding interviews.
It's expressed using `Big O` notation.

### Space Complexity

A measure of how much auxiliary memory an algorithm takes up, space complexity is a central concept it the field of algorithms and in coding interviews.
It's expressed using `Big O` notation.
