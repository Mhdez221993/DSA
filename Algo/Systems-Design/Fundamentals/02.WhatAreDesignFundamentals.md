# What Are Design Fundamentals?

> Building scalable, production-ready applications is both art and science. Science, <br>
> in that it requires knowledge of many topics in computer engineering; art, in that <br>
> it demands an eye for making smart design choices and piecing together the right technologies. <br>

> Master both disciplines and you, too, can become a Systems Expert.
